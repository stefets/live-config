# My musical companion with MIDIDINGS as the KERNEL

# Notes
* Entry point is /src/run.sh SCENE (if SCENE is not specified, default is assumed)
* ./run.sh create a file called script.py (in .gitignore)
* Scenes are located in /src/scenes/*
* Example : ./load.sh debug
* You MUST replace @@TOKEN@@ in the main.py template with you own logic
