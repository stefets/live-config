# My musical companion with MIDIDINGS as the KERNEL

# Notes
* Entry point is /src/live.sh SCENE (if SCENE is not specified, default is assumed)
* ./live.sh create a complete file for mididings called script.py (in .gitignore)
* Scenes are located in /src/scenes/*
* Example : ./live.sh debug
* You MUST replace tokens in the main.py template with you own logic

# Mididings users
## I maintain two UI for mididings
## Flaskdings 
### It's a UI and a rest API, using websockets and made with Flask
* https://github.com/stefets/flaskdings - Try it and star it !
## Node Red Flow Mididings
### It's a UI made with Node Red. It's a (static and slower) clone of my Flaskdings UI
* https://github.com/stefets/node-red-flow-mididings - Try it and star it !
