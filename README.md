# My musical companion with MIDIDINGS as the KERNEL

# Notes
* Script entry point is /src/load.sh sceneFileName
* Scenes are located in /src/scenes/*.py
* Example : ./load.sh default
* The final script is generated at every load and it's /src/live-config.py

# Frontend
* I maintain an API and a frontend to drive a MIDIDINGS script
* https://github.com/stefets/flaskdings - Try it and star it !
